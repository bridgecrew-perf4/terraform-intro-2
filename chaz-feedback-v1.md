* Framing

* Style
  * consider going erither all-white? Or color?



Title: 

* [x] Introduction to Terraform by hosting a small website on AWS

* English language
  * Avoid 'isms' 
  * Mindful of acronyms
  * obviosuly...
* Better framing of "what do we need"
* typo in 'scatch' => scratch



* When talking about "what we are going to learn" say that we are looking at understanding basic Terraform, not AWS-specific things

* Before the demo
  * Mention what terraform is, where to get, what Hashicorp is (SLIDE)
  * Tell us what we are going to do (SLIDE)
  * A bucket, with a file, that we can  
  * [x] List of tools that we are going to use
    * [x] tfswitch
    * [x] terraform
      * [x] Helpful commands
* Introduce Terraform itself
* Is there some kind of ZSH presenter mode?



* need to call out AWS specific stuff a bit more clearly... particularly 



* Consisten use of worrds!
  * AWS Console != "website'
  * website ...?
  * policy...



* When talking about Variables, talk about "parametrising"...



* Demo itself:
  * Much easier if the code is already up there 
  * dull color for comments



* Where to go from here?
  * Add "bring your infra under TF when its not there yet..."
